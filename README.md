# Iris-Classification--KNN-Classification
This project focuses on classifying Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It involves loading and exploring the dataset, preprocessing features with scaling, training a KNN model, and evaluating its performance. The project also includes optimizing the number of neighbors for improved accuracy.
